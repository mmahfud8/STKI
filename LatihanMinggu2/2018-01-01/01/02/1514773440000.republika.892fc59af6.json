The dispatch of the young people to work on cruise ships is expected to be able to break the poverty chain. Moreover, the interest of young people in Bali to work on cruise ships is also quite high. But many of them are constrained by the high documentation cost and expensive flight tickets. Pastika previously stated that the Bali provincial government will cover all costs of passport, visa, or ticket. \"Therefore, do not think about the cost, the government will cover 100 percent of the costs,\" he remarked. Therefore, he called on the vocational school to prepare its students to be trained and equipped with the competence for working on cruise ships. \"I ask the school to register the poor students. If they want to work on cruise ships, focus on improving their education. Then increase their English language skills, so as to increase their competitiveness,\" the governor pointed out."}
